            <h3>05 Aug 2020</h3>
            
            <p>
                So I started a project in Python like I mentioned before. I wanted to create a Discord bot, but those are usually based in C# and JavaScript, and I don’t have much experience in either of those languages. So I thought I wouldn’t be able to build a bot in Python. BUT! I found a pretty cool Python library called discord.py that gives you a lot of support to build a bot in Python, so I used that to build the bot.
                <br><br>
                Like I said previously, the bot was going to be for Legends of Runeterra. I had a hard time figuring out what I wanted to name the bot, but who else to name it after than the best card player in all of Runeterra. Twisted Fate! Legend says he’s never lost a fair game…or played one!
            </p>
            
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/blog/post2/bot.png" alt="A picture of the bot's profile menu" class="center">
                <figcaption>Here's a picture of the Bot's Profile Page</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            As I was thinking about what I needed for the bot, I planned out a bunch of stuff I'd need to do/figure out: 
            
            <h4>Parsing the Deck Codes</h4>
            <p>I had to figure out how to parse a deckcode, which is how you share decks in the card game. They look like this: CEBAEAIEBALQWAQGA4EASGBCFAXDANZ2HYAACAICAYFA
            and I need to make that readable for humans. When I parsed the code, with my formatting, decoding, and MAGIC, it looks like this:
            </p>
            
            <figure>

                <img src="/images/blog/post2/deckdisplay.jpg" alt="A picture of a deck code that has been parsed" class="center">
                <figcaption>A deck that uses cards from Bilgewater and Piltover & Zaun</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <h4>Keyword Look-Up</h4>
            <p>I need to implement a way to display keywords for the cards, and what they do. You see, each card had different effects and they could be something like the Tough effect. That’s when a card takes 1 less damage from ALL sources. I needed a way to display that for people who wanted to look up keywords or if they wanted a list of all keywords entirely.</p>
            
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/blog/post2/toughcard.png" alt="A picture of a card that has the tough keyword" class="center">
                <figcaption>This Poro Card has Tough on it</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Card Look-Up</h4>
            <p>
            I need a way for people to look up card names in the bot, and see their stats, cost, and description. To be honest, I need to look more at the documentation for the libraries I'm using, because I haven't figured out a way to pull this information yet. 
            <br><br>
            With all that stated, one of the first things I did was look up the Runeterra API to find a way to parse the deck codes. They had a link to a C# GitHub repo explaining how the parsing worked, and they also had other libraries for other languages. So I installed two of the Python ones and started learning them. 
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, one of the libraries I'm using doesn't seem to be receiving frequent updates, which means that my bot won't be able to support the latest card sets. So I have to bench the bot project and make my own deck parsing library, so I can stop being dependent on other libraries. So I'll follow up in a separate post at some point once I've built the library, and then there will be another post continuing the work on the bot.
            <br><br>
            All the images used in this post are images that I took myself, except for the picture of the Plucky Poro card, which is a screenshot from the game Legends of Runeterra.

            <h3>10 Jul 2020</h3>
            
            <p>Now that the site is set up and designed, I need to actually fill it up. I’ve added some information to the Home and About pages, but I need to add more before I can consider them to be complete pages. I also need to start more side projects so I can actually fill up the projects section with stuff. I don’t know why, but I really just feel like using Python lately, so I’ve been looking at some projects I can do in Python. Currently, I’ve been considering building either a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">Web Scraper</a> application, or a Discord Bot for Legends of Runeterra (Which is currently one of my favourite games).</p>

            <p>
                I’ll probably post about which ever I decide to do, and some of the logic I’ll use in the actual application. Why I picked one option over the other, and why I choose to do things a certain way. Till the next post!
