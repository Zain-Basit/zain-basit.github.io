            <h4>Coded a Discord bot that parses deck codes for Legends of Runeterra</h4>
            <h5>August 2020 - Present<br> Currently In Progress</h5>
            
            <figure id="projectdis">
                <img src="images/blog/post2/deckdisplay.jpg" alt="A deckcode that has been parsed being displayed in discord">
                <figcaption>A deck code that has been parsed, being displayed in discord. <br>Source: This picture is my own work. </figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The bot essentially parses deck codes like the following: CEBAEAIEBALQWAQGA4EASGBCFAXDANZ2HYAACAICAYFA into a format that is readable for humans. When parsed, it is displayed like the image on the right.</li>
                <li>Done using the discord.py library, so I can make the both in Python rather than JavaScript and C#. Discord Bots are usually coded in those two languages, but by using that library I can use Python instead.</li>
                <li>Used the Discord developer portal to be able to have the bot run on Discord, since it needs an "account" on the platform.</li>
                <li>Used two external libraries called LorDeckCodes and twisted-fate, both of which allowed me to build the bot to work. However, the twisted-fate bot is not being updated anymore. So I am developing a new library myself, so I can reduce the dependance on external pieces of code.</li>
                <li>Also created a detailed documentation command for the bot, that any user can access by using the help command.</li>

            <h4>Built a Replica of Flabby Bird using MIPs</h4>
            <h5>April 2020 <br> Completed </h5>
            
            
            <ul>
                <li>Coded entirely in assembly</li>
                <li>Coded the background to shift colours by accessing the memory pointers</li>
                <li>Added the option to play with two players</li>
                <li>Involved a lot of memory management, and extension documentation of what the code does.<br> Since Assembly is so complex, without proper documentation it is hard to determine what the code actually does.</li>
                <li>Code will be available at this link in June 2023: <a href="https://github.com/Zain-Basit/repo_flappybird" target=_blank>Flappy Bird Repository</a></li>
