            <p>I currently live in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, and I am a student at the University of Toronto. I'm majoring in Mathematics & CCIT. 
                I enjoy a lot of things, some of them are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading, I'm a really big reader, and I currently have a lot of books on the read list once I have some time.</li>
                <li>Walking, I really enjoy going out on walks, it's something that I find really therapeutic. Sometimes I even get to see rabbits or squirrels!</li>
                <li>Anime, this is something I've been getting into more lately, and I'm really loving the genre.</li>
                <li>Video Games, sometimes it's super fun to just sit down and play with some friends. Especially when you're all goofing off instead of playing the game.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reading</h2>

            </figure>
            
            <p>Currently, I've got a couple books that I want to read once I've got some free time. A friend of mine gave me the <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> for my 
            birthday, and a cool comic book about Batman and the Flash. So I'm trying to read those, and I also really want to read Book 5 of the <i>Red Rising Series</i>. I read the 
            first few books years ago, and I'm really excited to see how the rest of the story plays out. </p>
            
            <p>I've always been a super big DC fan, and I've read a decent amount of the comics. So I was super excited when I got the Button comic book, because Batman and
                the Flash are my favourite characters in the DC universe. It's just super cool having super speed and being able to do everything the Flash does, he can 
                <b>time travel</b>, imagine how insane that is. He can do all his tasks and work so fast and have time to do whatever he wants, without having to worry about stuff
                like deadlines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Batman is just really interesting to me, because on the surface he's just a rich guy who beats up criminals. But then you find out his backstory, 
                how he trained with assassins, and how he starts a whole family of heroes. He's like the first in the massive bat family, with five different Robins, you have
                Batwoman, Nightwing, and so many other heroes that would not have existed if it weren't for him. It's the fact that he refuses to kill criminals, even though he 
                knows that they will just break out of prison again and again, causing more harm to innocent people. It's quite ridiculous actually, how easily the criminals in 
                Gotham are able to get out of prison. It's as though they barely even arrive there, and then they are ready out on the streets causing chaos.

            <p>Red Rising is a really interesting series of Books, that start with a boy named Darrow. Darrow is a red, and a miner on Mars, and he is a member of society. The 
                society in Red Rising is a class based system, where you have The Golds at the top. The Golds are a completely different breed of human compared to the other classes lower
                than them. The Golds are stronger, faster, healthier, and are educated and trained to fight from birth. The Reds and other low classes usually are not so lucky, they 
                are treated as trash and used as a resource. Darrow comes from a low red family, and he thinks that the ore he mines, is to transform Mars and make it habitable for the 
                scoiety, and then he will be able to live on the surface. In reality, Mars has been habitable for centuries already, and his people are being deceived. Darrow finds out, and
                he swears to make sure that the Reds will be able to walk free. So, things start getting pretty crazy, four books later, things are getting crazier still.

            <h2>Walking</h2>

            <p>There's a really nice forest near my home that I like to walk through, its really nice since I can get some form of exercise and I get to enjoy some fresh air.</p>

            <h2>TV Shows & Anime</h2>

            <p>I also really enjoy watching TV shows, with some of my favourite shows being <i>the Wire</i>, and <i>Mr. Robot</i>. Both are really good shows, with the entire plot
            planned out seasons in advance. Because of that, there is a lot of detail in the shows. I've also been watching more anime lately, since I've been recommended it
            by friends. <i>Vinland Saga</i>, <i>The Promised Neverland</i>, and <i>Attack on Titan</i> are probably my favourites right now. Really excited to see how their next
            seasons go.
            <br><br>
            <em>Vinland Saga</em> in particular is going to be a really big series, it's about the Vikings and it takes place during the 1300's. It follows a group of Viking mercenaries, and one boy in particular who wants revenge for the murder of his father. But will only fight his father's killer in a duel, one-on-one, because he feels that fighting him in any other way will dishonour his father's memory. While he's out looking for revenge, there are wars happening and invasions of England by the Great Danish Army. The show is historically accurate which makes it so interesting to watch. I've attached the trailer for the first season on the right if you're interested in watching it.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>

            <p>Currently, I only play two games somewhat consistently. I play <i>Apex Legends</i> and <i>Legends of Runeterra</i></p>
            
            <p><i>Apex Legends</i> is a battle royale style game, where you are dropped into an arena with your teammates, and you have to fight to win the game.
                I've really been enjoying it with my friends and a lot of fun, especially since all the characters have different abilites that drastically change what
                you can actually do in the game.
            </p>
            
            <p> <i>Legends of Runeterra</i> is a card game, that revolves around making card decks and dueling other players. It involves a lot of strategy which means that 
                you cannot take a random deck and just start winning. You can have silly deck concepts, which may not be the best deck, but they can be super fun to play. Having so
                much flexibility in what you can do is what makes the game so much fun for me. You end up with so many funny moments where the players are doing goofy things that
                are really creative.
