            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            
            <p>My name is Zain, and I'm currently a third-year student at the University of Toronto Mississauga. This website is meant to be a portfolio website that contains information about myself and some of my hobbies. It will also have my resume and past/current projects listed on it as well.
            <br><br>
            I'm mostly interested in stuff related to computer science, and that's why most of my projects are code related. However, I am getting into front-end design more and more, it's honestly quite fun to design a webpage. Especially since some of the courses I've taken are focusing more on front end stuff, so I'm experiementing with things that I find interesting.
            <br><br>
            Iâ€™ll also be blogging on the site somewhat regularly, so check it out sometimes. You can see what Iâ€™m working on, or what Iâ€™m doing in general. I think itâ€™ll be good to get my thoughts and ideas on
            some written medium, and this might be one of the best ways to do it. Iâ€™ll be able to improve my story telling skills as well, so thereâ€™s some benefits to it as well.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What am I up to?</h2>
            
            <p>
            I'm currently working on a bot that parses deck codes for Riot Games popular card game, <em>Legends of Runeterra.</em> I've had to stop adding new features since the library I was using earlier is not receiving constant updates. So, I am making my own library so my bot is independent and only uses my own code. 
            <br><br>
            I'm also starting a new project soon that'll use the Django framework for Python. It's still in the early phases, so I can't provide much detail yet. I'm planning on working on it with one of my coworkers, and it'll be something we can use to showcase our skills. Besides that I'm also looking for an intership for Summer 2021 and Winter/Fall 2021.

            <h2>Some Cool Songs</h2>
            <p>Here are some songs that are pretty good, I've mostly just been listening to the songs that Spotify thinks I'll like, and for the most part it's pretty accurate. Some 
                of the songs I really enjoy now are from shows I've watched before that had really great sound tracks.</p>

            <h2> ðŸ‘½ SPACE ðŸš€</h2> 

            <p>I'm also really into space, and I especially find blackholes really cool since there's a lot that we don't know about them. Here's a NASA article about blackholes, and
                a link to the first ever picture of a blackhole. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/black_hole_description.html" target="_blank">It's a 
                pretty cool read and something worth checking out!</a>
                <br><br>
                Fun fact, did you know that NASA was planning to colonize the moon by 2024? It's kind of crazy to think about, but it's definitely something I hope I get to see. The plans have been delayed to 2028, but regardless of what happens, it'll be crazy. To my knowledge, this will be the first time humanity has attempted to establish a colony off of the Earth. I hope the mission goes well, and that they're able to establish a base there. I've linked the full article below, so feel free to read it and take a look. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moon-to-mars/overview">Here are their plans, very interesting thing to read.</a>
                <br><br>
                One last thing about space, did you know that there's actually a lot of stuff that humans have put into space? There's so much that scientists have coined a term called "space junk," or space debris (if you prefer the formal definition). One of these so called pieces of space junk is Elon Musk's personal car, it was lauched into space as apart of a test of a new rocket made by SpaceX. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk%27s_Tesla_Roadster">You can read about it here.</a>
